/**
 * Thread-safe, multi-threaded asynchronous write queue.
 *
 * This class provides a simple way to call a method on a class,
 * asynchronously. That is, the method is called in a *different*
 * thread, at some later time. This can be very handy if the method
 * takes a long time to run, or if it blocks waiting on I/O.  By
 * running in a different thread, it allows the current thread to
 * return immediately.  It also enables concurrency: a large number of
 * threads can handle the time-consuming work in parallel, while the
 * master thread can zip along.
 *
 * You'd think that there would be some BOOST function for this, but
 * there doesn't seem to be ...
 *
 * This class allows a simple implmentation of a thread-safe, multi-
 * threaded write queue. It is currently used by the persistant storage
 * class, to write atoms out to disk.
 *
 * What actually happens is this: The given elements are placed on a
 * queue (in a thread-safe manner -- thie enqueue function can be safely
 * called from multiple threads.) This queue is then serviced and
 * drained by a pool of active threads, which dequeue the elements, and
 * call the method on each one.
 *
 * The implementation is very simple: it uses a fixed-size thread pool.
 * It uses hi/lo watermarks to stall and drain the queue, if it gets too
 * long. This could probably be made spiffier.
 *
 * It would also be clearer to the user, if we placed the method to call
 * onto the queue, along with the element, instead of specifying the
 * method in the ctor. This would really drive home the point that this
 * really is just an async method call.
 *
 * The number of threads to use for writing is fixed, when the ctor is
 * called.  The default is 4 threads.  This can be set to zero, if
 * desired; as a result, all writes will be *synchronous*.  This can
 * be a useful thing to do, if this class is being used in a temporary
 * instance somewhere, and the overhead of creating threads is to be
 * avoided. (For example, temporary AtomTables used during evaluation.)
